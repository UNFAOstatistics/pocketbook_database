To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.","EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database: www.emdat.be, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium), World Bank.","World Bank (WDI)","raw","",NA,NA,"EN.CLC.MDAT.ZS","","natural disasters",NA

For the MUV (15) index, unit value indexes in local currency for each country are converted to U.S. dollars using market exchange rates and are combined using weights determined by the share of each country's exports in G15 exports to low- and middle-income countries. The shares are calculated using SITC revision 3 Manufactures exports data from UN COMTRADE in 2005, the base year. The primary manufacturing prices index source is OECD's Domestic Producer Price Index (PPI) for manufacturing. Whenever PPI is not available, export price indexes or the export unit values are used as proxies. The countries and relative weights (in parentheses) are: Brazil (2.95%), Canada (0.93%), China (11.79%), France (5.87%), Germany (13.29%), India (1.77%), Italy (6.07%), Japan (16.70%), Mexico (0.93%), South Africa (0.75%), South Korea (10.95%), Spain (2.30%), Thailand (2.51%), United Kingdom (3.50%), and United States (19.68%).","World Bank, Development Prospects Group; Historical US GDP deflator: US Department of Commerce.","World Bank","raw","",NA,NA,"","","",NA

Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms which are harvested by an individual or corporate body which has owned them throughout their rearing period contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licenses, are the harvest of fisheries. In the case of capture-based aquaculture, only the incremental growth (or weight gain) in captivity, could and should be reported as the production from aquaculture.
