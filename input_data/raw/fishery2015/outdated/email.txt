Dear Amy,



 

As agreed, I am sending to you attachments containing most of the fishery data required for the 2015 FAO Statistical Yearbook.

 

I wish to inform you that the data related to “State of the world’s fishery stocks (CHART 79)”, “Table on Value of fish trade”, as well as updated text, will be provided by the respective responsible officers as soon as available.

 



A few notes concerning the data included in the attachments:



-As for the table on “Fishery and aquaculture production”, the sheet “Final Table” presents a table similar to what published in previous edition. However, if needed, hidden rows can be revealed to show all countries/territories included in each region/continent. In the same way, unhiding all columns, UN-codes for country and other codes will be visible.


-As for Map 47 and 48, new groupings are proposed with a different range of values. I hope they can be taken into account.


-As for CHART 80, slightly different groups of species are presented.


-As for MAP 49, I noted that the indicator referring to Europe Inland Waters is placed in Russia. Although it correctly centred over the concerned region, I wonder if readers understand that it refers to all Europe and I would preferably move it to west.




Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need additional information.

 

Kind regards,
